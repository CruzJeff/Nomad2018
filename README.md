Nomad2018 Kaggle Competition

Innovative materials design is needed to tackle some of the most important health, environmental, energy, social, and economic challenges of this century. In particular, improving the properties of materials that are intrinsically connected to the generation and utilization of energy is crucial if we are to mitigate environmental damage due to a growing global demand. Transparent conductors are an important class of compounds that are both electrically conductive and have a low absorption in the visible range, which are typically competing properties. A combination of both of these characteristics is key for the operation of a variety of technological devices such as photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes for flat-panel displays, transistors, sensors, touch screens, and lasers. However, only a small number of compounds are currently known to display both transparency and conductivity suitable enough to be used as transparent conducting materials.


This competition aims to accomplish this goal by asking participants to develop or apply data analytics/data mining/machine-learning models for the prediction of two target properties: the formation energy (which is an indication of the stability of a new material) and the bandgap energy (which is an indication of the potential for transparency over the visible range) to facilitate the discovery of new transparent conductors and allow for advancements in the above-mentioned technologies.
