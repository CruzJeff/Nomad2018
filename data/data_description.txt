High-quality data are provided for 3,000 materials that show promise as transparent conductors. The following information has been included:

Spacegroup (a label identifying the symmetry of the material)
Total number of Al, Ga, In and O atoms in the unit cell 
Relative compositions of Al, Ga, and In (x, y, z)
Lattice vectors and angles: lv1, lv2, lv3 (which are lengths given in units of angstroms (10−1010−10 meters) and α, β, γ (which are angles in degrees between 0° and 360°)
A domain expert will understand the physical meaning of the above information but those with a data mining background may simply use the data as input for their models.

The task for this competition is to predict two target properties:

Formation energy (an important indicator of the stability of a material)
Bandgap energy (an important property for optoelectronic applications)

File Descriptions:
Note: For each line of the CSV file, the corresponding spatial positions of all of the atoms in the unit cell (expressed in Cartesian coordinates) are provided as a separate file.

train.csv - contains a set of materials for which the bandgap and formation energies are provided

test.csv - contains the set of materials for which you must predict the bandgap and formation energies

/{train|test}/{id}/geometry.xyz - files with spatial information about the material. The file name corresponds to the id in the respective csv files.
